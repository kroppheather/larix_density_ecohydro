#### Larix sap flow data processing and analysis

Analysis of transpiration and ecohydrological measurements in two stands of a Siberian larch forest located in the continuous permafrost zone near the Northeastern Science Station. This analysis processes sapflow data and characterizes differences between transpiration, micrometeorological data, root biomass and soil characteristics across two stands. The analysis includes a stomatal conductance model to characterize stomatal responses to environmental drivers. The analysis association with the ViPER project. The objective of this project is to examine the impacts of vegetation and ecosystem properties on active layer and permafrost thermal dynamics in order to better understand the vulnerability of permafrost to climate change.
